Development repository of the Austrian e-Invoicing standard ebInterface. For the officially released standard versions as well as the standard documentations, please refer to the ebInterface website [http://www.ebinterface.at](http://www.ebinterface.at)

# What's ebInterface?

ebInterface is a lightweight XML standard for electronic invoices, developed by [AUSTRIAPRO](http://www.austriapro.at), a subsidiary of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce ([Wirtschaftskammer Österreich](http://www.wko.at)). The goal of ebInterface is to facilitate the exchange of electronic documents between businesses (B2B) as well as between businesses and governmental organizations (B2G).

Since 1.1.2014 the Republic of Austria does not accept paper-based invoices any more and invoices must be submitted electronically using the ebInterface format or using the UBL format via PEPPOL.

Further information for sending invoices to the Republic of Austria may be found under [http://www.e-rechnung.gv.at](http://www.e-rechnung.gv.at)
