Development repository of the Austrian e-Invoicing standard ebInterface. For the official standard versions please refer to the ebInterface website http://www.ebinterface.at


This repository contains two main artifacts:

ebInterface XML Schema files
----------------------------

Using this repository the development versions of the different ebInterface standard schemas are shared among the standard developers.


ebInterface validation service
------------------------------

The ebInterface validation service allows to validate ebInterface instances according to the ebInterface XML Schema version 3.0, 3.02, and 4.0.

The validation includes XML Schema conformance, conformance to predefined Schematron rules, and the validation of digital signatures.

Additionally, the validation service allows to visualize ebInterface XML instances by applying XSL stylesheets.
